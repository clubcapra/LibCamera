To use the project:
1. Run "make"

3. Use the module by calling "import camera" in python

To use the CodeBlocks project, the CodeBlocks settings must be modified by going in "Advanced Options" section, through the Settings>Compiler menu, in the "Other Settings" tab. In the "Command" combobox, select "Link object files to dynamic libraries" and swap the $libs and $link_options parameters. This will allow the linking options to be placed at the complete end of the command. It is required for PvAPI to link with librt.
